## More about me and my skills

I started to learn frontend development in 2013 while studying.
My first production experience was in 2018, I built a company phonebook based on Django Templates. Now I'm writing educational topics for [Hyperskill (commercial + NDA)](https://hyperskill.org/) and [Doka (opensource)](https://doka.guide/).
[Looking](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bdanila/) for new teams, ideas and projects!

### Current experience

I have done at least four production projects, all of them was based on different technologies, so I learned Node.js (REST API, Nodemailer, JWT authentication), Vue.js and. Nuxt.js (Vitest, Vite, Webpack, Jest, Storybook) frameworks. Have experience with Django, Strapi, Pocketbase, and PHP as a backend. Have a lot of experience with declarative components, accessible HTML  markup, and high performance CSS.
